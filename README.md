# jc://music-box/

This software is built to run mp3-music - files and web-streams - on a _Raspberry Pi 3B+_ in a wooden box with speakers. It consists of:

- *App (web interface)* to show and manage content and control playback (HTML5/JavaScript)
- *Main Server* to import and manage content and control playback (Python)
- *LED Server* to show volume and status via LED (Python)
- *Button Server* to read commands via push buttons and send to main server (Python)

## Idea behind the box

A friend has built a similar box based on an existing free software. As my children where faszinated from this box I decided to build such a box for my children, but to write the software on my own from the scratch to try out different development practices. So it's not my idea but my individual implementation of this idea.

## Disclaimer

I'm just starting to publish my code and to work with GitHub. So the projects are not complete at the moment but will grow.
